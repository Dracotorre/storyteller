Storyteller theme for Octopress is designed for sharing collections of articles such as fiction serials or tutorials optionally using table of contents (toc) pages. Each post may include a next-page link, beneficial when articles in several collections overlap by post-date order. An optional link above the post takes the reader back to the toc or to the previous article. These links are set in the post header. See the [Storyteller page on GitHub](https://github.com/Dracotorre/storyteller) for details.
